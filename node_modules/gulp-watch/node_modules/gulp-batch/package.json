So here it is:\n\n```js\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar batch = require('gulp-batch');\n\ngulp.watch(['lib/**', 'test/**'], batch(function(events) {\n    return events.pipe(console.log);\n}));\n```\n\n## API\n\n### batch([options,] callback, [errorHandler])\n\nThis function creates batcher for provided callback.\nIt will call it, when bunch of events happens near in time, so you will\nbe running your test only once per `git checkout` command (for example).\n\n__Callback signature__: `function(events, [done])`.\n\n * `events` - is `Stream` of incoming events.\n * `done` - is callback for your function signal to batch, that you are done. This allows to run your callback as soon as previous end. Error can be passed as argument.\n\n__Options__:\n\n * `limit` - Maximum events number, that gets into one batch (default: `undefined` - unlimited)\n * `timeout` - Interval in milliseconds, that counts as \"no more events will arrive\" (default: `200`)\n\n__Errors__:\n\nAll errors in batched function will be passed to `errorHandler`.\n\n__Returns__:\n\nWrapped callback, that will gather events and call callback.\n\n# License\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Vsevolod Strukchinsky (floatdrop@gmail.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
